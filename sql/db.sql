Hard to imagine you reading a story about enterprise software if it wasn&rsquo;t a part of your working life. Then again, Slack has always been a little weird like that. A year and a half ago, no one had ever heard of it. A few days later, everyone you knew was using it.</p>\n','<p>Okay, not&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>. But all the startups had taken their workplace chatter there, and then the media did, too. And once something is being used by all of the startups and all of the media, it begins to feel inevitable and then necessary. (This is the entire story of Twitter.)</p>\n\n<p>300,000 OF SLACK&#39;S 1.1 MILLION USERS USE THE PAID VERSION</p>\n\n<p>Of Slack&rsquo;s 1.1 million users, 300,000 use the paid version. Employers will pay between $6.67 and $48 a month per user for the hottest Slack features, such as a searchable archive with unlimited messages ($6.67 a month, if billed annually); an archive of everything you have ever typed, for compliance purposes ($12.50 a month, billed annually) and &quot;a configurable email ingestion service,&quot; $48, which sounds disgusting.</p>\n\n<p>Slack projects its revenues around $25 million this year. It has raised $340 million, and&nbsp;is valued at $2.8 billion. At least, that&rsquo;s how much it was worth in April. Who knows what it would be valued at today. Pick any number you like &mdash; $8 billion, say. Slack will probably be worth that at some point. November, maybe?</p>\n\n<p>SLACK WILL GENERATE REVENUES OF $25 MILLION THIS YEAR</p>\n\n<p>Some people use Slack for free. There is a writers&rsquo; Slack, and an LGBTQ Slack, and a Slack for former Twitter employees, who hang out in Slack all day long and LOL at the day&rsquo;s Twitter news.&nbsp;There is ChitCats, &quot;a place to discover and join private Slack groups,&quot; where people vote on Slacks, Reddit-style.</p>\n\n<p>This week a group named Free Code Camp sent me an email with the promising subject line &quot;Slack is lying to its users.&quot; The founder of Free Code Camp, Quincy Larson, complained that while Slack promises it is free to an&nbsp;<em>unlimited</em>&nbsp;number of users, this week code campers reached the previously undocumented free Slack limit of 8,462 people. A spokeswoman for Slack said this: &quot;Slack plainly says about the free plan, &lsquo;We offer a free plan for small teams, casual users, and anyone who wants to evaluate Slack.&rsquo; Based on that, it&rsquo;s difficult to infer Slack would be an appropriate tool for use by a 10,000-person community.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Slack&rsquo;s&nbsp;pricing&nbsp;page&nbsp;really does say there are &quot;no limits on time or users,&quot; though, so at some point Slack will have to change the language there. It won&rsquo;t be that big of a deal.</p>\n\n<p>FREE UP TO 8,462 USERS</p>\n\n<p>Slack is successful because it integrates with other things &mdash; about 100 other things right now. Workplace chat apps are a dime a dozen, so as best as anyone can tell, it&rsquo;s these integrations that made Slack a big deal. For example, you can set up a chat room that tells you every time people mention your #brand on Twitter. (Your brand sucks!) Or you can set up a room that imports every picture that Beyonc&eacute; posts to Instagram. Or you can have Github do things in your Slack, if you are a code person. Slack users have set up 900,000 of these integrations so far, and they send 30 million messages a week.</p>\n\n<p>Slack is not perfect. Months ago, its founder, Stewart Butterfield, told me you would soon be able to leave emoji comments on Slack messages. For example, if someone said something poopy, you could comment with a poop emoji, and so could your co-workers, and in time you would return to view the poopy message, and it would have eight poops next to it. This hasn&rsquo;t shipped yet, and I for one would like to know what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>\n\n<p>Slack also leads employees to&nbsp;near-constant goofing around, whether by playing games of Jeopardy! or using Giphy to punctuate every sentence with random animations. John Herrman memorably called this &quot;mainstream work larping.&quot;&nbsp;Certainly you will observe people at your company who never have time for&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;but are incredibly active on Slack, hunting through every chat room in search of someone to banter with for a few more moments before returning to their TPS reports.</p>\n\n<p>A PERSISTENT LOW-LEVEL WORK ANXIETY THAT WILL HAUNT YOU UNTIL THE END OF TIME</p>\n\n<p>But you will also observe people who barely pay attention to Slack at all, and you will resent them for it, and at some point someone you work with who is terrible at Slack will be fired for not being &quot;a culture fit,&quot; and you&rsquo;ll understand that these two things are likely related. How much should you participate in Slack? What is the right amount of GIFs? These will add to the persistent, low-level work anxieties that you will carry around for the rest of your days.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, look at Google Docs. Until&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;recently &mdash; yesterday, maybe? &mdash; opening a Google Doc through Slack took three clicks. The first click opened a useless sidebar. The second click opened a browser tab that contained a link to the Google Doc in a format that looked exactly like the tab in the useless sidebar. Then you clicked&nbsp;<em>that</em>link and finally your Google Doc opened. I asked Slack to fix this on Twitter last week, and a couple people chimed in, and this morning when I went to open a Google Doc through Slack, it opened with a single click.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, 1.1 million people, $25 million, $2.8 billion. The numbers look big today. They won&rsquo;t tomorrow.</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-02 12:37:16',NULL,NULL,NULL),

We see the world as filled with possibility and we want all of the wonders to manifest quickly. ','0','<p>I am a Geek - I LOVE anything sci-fi, fantasy, rpg, historical, game like (board games, video games, card games), reading (anything and everything), comics. I was raised on Star Trek, Dr Who, Star Wars, Battlestar Gallactica, etol.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy to take the label of Geek and apply it to myself - do you know why? Because.... well finally the Geeks are taking over the world.</p>\n\n<p>You only have to look at the amount of money Comic Book &amp; Sci-fi/Fantasy movies/television rake in. Comic Conventions, Sci-Fi Conventions - tickets sell out in seconds - thousands of people are going to these things.</p>\n\n<p>There has been a significant increase in the amount of quality television shows based on comics or fantasy fiction - GoT, The Flash, Arrow, Super Girl, Smallville, Gotham, Constantine, Daredevil.</p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, been called a Geek was a death sentence for your social life; now, I have more friends that are into comics, sci-fi, fantasy and gaming, then I do friends who don&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>Geeks are intelligent, creative and fun individuals, who you know will be able to hold an intelligent conversation. When you have that group of friends who are all as excited as you about the new Star Wars movie or who are super jealous because you have announced you will be making every effort to obtain tickets to E3 and Comic-Con Sandiego in 2016 - you know, you are truly blessed.</p>\n\n<p>Every couple of weeks, my husband, my brother, 2 of my work mates and 2 of my theatre mates and myself all get together to play D&amp;D. During our breaks during the gaming session, we are all nattering away about the latest GoT or Flash episode. We are all super psyched for the new Star Wars movie and don&#39;t get us started on how excited we all are, when a new Pixar or Disney movie comes out.</p>\n\n<p>I look at the actors who portray our favorite superheroes or starship captain, many of them have become icons. They are all role models, their facebook and twitter pages are used to raise awareness of some really important issues. They play characters who are all, a mix of true Geek qualities - intelligence, creativity, street and book smarts, a willingness to try to change the world. Even the villains (the majority of the time) have high intelligence and creativity.</p>\n\n<p>It is time that we stopped teaching kids that been a &#39;Jock&#39; makes you the best of the best. We need to teach kids that to be the best, you need to be a Jock but also the Geek - you must read books, you need to appreciate the thoughts/opinions/creativity of others.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think that those who really make it in the world, are the ones who want to embody all of the above traits - they learn continually, they know how to work in a team, they know when to work alone, they strive to achieve in everything and know it takes work and practice. They are the thinkers and the doers. Even if they don&#39;t have the massive IQ, they work to their strengths and use other smarts.</p>\n\n<p>Been a Geek means you see the world in colour, you see the wonder that is the world we live in and in the space we occupy. We see the world as filled with possibility and we want all of the wonders to manifest quickly. We work to fight the wrongs, we stick up for the little guy and we say No to the bullies.</p>\n\n<p>I am a Geek! I am very proud to be one.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n\n<p>http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/07/05/why-i-love-been-labelled-a-geek-3358551?lt_source=external,manual</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-05 05:37:27',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Looking for a sign of the tech-influenced times? Regardless of how long they&#39;d been married, most couples (76%) say they would have preferred to register for an Ultra HD TV &ndash; a display that handles video that&#39;s four times the resolution of regular HDTVs &ndash; than a formal china place setting.</span></p>\n\n<p>More couples consider technology items appropriate for gift registries, according to a survey of brides and grooms commissioned by retailer&nbsp;Best Buy. Those married within the last five years were more likely to consider that OK (74% approved), but even 58% of couples who&#39;ve been married 20 years or more approved.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Technology is of course ever present today and couples are really starting to include these tools in their weddings &ndash; including their gift registries,&quot; said Wendy Fritz, head of gifting registry for Best Buy, which began its own registry in February. &quot;It&#39;s no longer about a fancy china place setting, it&#39;s about a flat screen TV for a new home or a digital camera for the honeymoon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Could they do it all over again, most couples married more than 20 years (75% of them) wish that they could have tech items on their registry. The most popular gift desires? A TV, camera or video camera, a tablet, smart thermostat and wireless sound system.</p>\n\n<p>Most of those surveyed (74%) said they would prefer a useful gift such as a tech product over a sentimental gift.

The account tied to your phone will act as the default you&rsquo;ll use to register with the service, and all purchases (including your subscription), will be charged to the card you use in the iTunes App Store.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (1)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221384\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x534xFullSizeRender-1-623x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.aug2VR5PWm.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:534px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (4)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221381\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x540xFullSizeRender-4-616x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic._1q4fZDIoT.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:540px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Customizing the Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Once the account is cleared you&rsquo;ll be taken to a screen that asks you which genres you&rsquo;re interested in the most. With the genre chosen, a cloud of various artists will pour in. If you don&rsquo;t see anything that pops out at you on the first page, you can tap the button in the bottom right to spawn more artist bubbles in the cloud.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (6)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221379\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x549xFullSizeRender-6-606x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oj1auljP4l.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:549px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (5)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221380\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x563xFullSizeRender-5-591x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.0Et6EI_a0v.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:563px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Once you find an artist you like, you can tap it once for &ldquo;like&rdquo;, or twice for &ldquo;love&rdquo;, after which the artist will blow up its size accordingly. If you see any that you could do without, just hold down your finger on their name for three seconds, after which they&rsquo;ll be deleted from the list.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (7)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221389\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x678xFullSizeRender-7-604x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.gHzjcG3jbz.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:678px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is how Apple Music will start off by learning your preferences for everything &ndash; from what to play on the radio to what artists and albums are recommended during new release Tuesdays &ndash; so be as specific as you can to have the best possible chance of scoring a match in your general listening profile.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (14)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221393\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x572xFullSizeRender-14.jpg.pagespeed.ic.libh_PdV8M.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:572px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In case your suggestions&nbsp;don&rsquo;t seem to fit later on, you can always go back in and reset the artist cloud by finding the option in your settings menu.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>User Interface and Overall Feel</strong></h3>\n\n<p>On its face, Apple Music doesn&rsquo;t stray too far from the aesthetic that the company first established with the design overhaul in iOS 8. Clean, matte lines are accented by Apple&rsquo;s trademark white glow, and just like the lock screen, the text of whichever album you&rsquo;re viewing will take on the colors of the cover art for that extra little dose of immersion.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (30)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221411\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x680xFullSizeRender-30-602x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.HL_2RrIrv_.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:680px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, all the buttons you need are here, and none feel out of place from where they ended up. Skip tracks using the arrows, check a playlist using the &ldquo;chart&rdquo; button, and share with the same icon you&rsquo;d use to upload a photo from your camera roll.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (11)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221385\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x673xFullSizeRender-11-608x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.O2G0CXQCEg.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:673px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the My Music tab, you&rsquo;ll see all the songs you&rsquo;ve saved from radio using the hearted &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; icon, along with any music that&rsquo;s already been stored locally on the device.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"imageedit_5_3276744794\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221436\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/410x698ximageedit_5_3276744794-601x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.z3JZc4pQLG.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:698px; margin-left:-2px; width:410px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Connect to Your Artists</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Connect is Apple&rsquo;s answer to Spotify&rsquo;s &ldquo;Follow&rdquo; feature, which gives users the opportunity to not only see when their favorite artists have released new music or tour dates, but also get an inside look at what they&rsquo;re listening to on their own accounts.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (10)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221386\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x550xFullSizeRender-10-605x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.SGPW6sfFeo.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:550px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (9)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221387\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x552xFullSizeRender-9-603x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.bWeGFM03I1.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:552px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<p>If we had to give it to either side, for now the advantage would sneak slightly over to Apple Music. Connect is an improvement on Follow in almost every way, faulted only for the fact that it&rsquo;s the first thing you&rsquo;ll see if click on an artist from search and they have it enabled (instead of their actual music).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (27)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221402\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x677xFullSizeRender-27-605x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.GuD6InyS8w.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:677px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Radio and Available Music Library</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Both Spotify and Apple Music made the same deal with the record companies, and because neither are interested in stepping outside the bounds of copyright law, both have a nearly identical library of 30 million+ songs from all the same artists as the other. Apple has promised its service would feature exclusive albums from a select few artists such as Taylor Swift, though it&rsquo;s still too early to say whether there will actually be enough added content to justify the switch.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (31)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221410\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x479xFullSizeRender-31.jpg.pagespeed.ic.CP8CeTd9JC.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:479px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Radio (found in the &ldquo;Radio&rdquo; tab mounted along the bottom navigation bar), works just as it has in Pandora and Spotify before it, using either pre-made genre stations or the &ldquo;Start Radio from this song&rdquo; feature to acutely customize your playlist</p>\n\n<p>.<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221398\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x680xFullSizeRender-20-602x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.QblW_n-S9H.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:680px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you watched Apple&rsquo;s Music keynote earlier this month, you&rsquo;ll know the company has also debuted one major addition that&rsquo;s exclusive to its service alone: real, live radio. Instead of simply selecting a series of songs to listen to, Beats 1 Radio will feature actual DJs, in-studio interviews, and all the bonuses you&rsquo;d expect from a full-fledged radio station in your car. Combine this with NPR and ESPN Radio, and Apple&rsquo;s already&nbsp;got themselves a nice head start into the live market over their competition.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (19)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221399\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x415xFullSizeRender-19.jpg.pagespeed.ic.Gwm7lAow95.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:415px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"imageedit_7_4394847884\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221437\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x294ximageedit_7_4394847884.jpg.pagespeed.ic.f_Hnbheh69.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:294px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Assorted Perks</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Aside from these choice picks&nbsp;though, most of what you&rsquo;ll find on Apple Music has already existed on Spotify for years now. Sections in Music like &ldquo;Staff Picks&rdquo; &ldquo;Mood Playlists&rdquo; &ldquo;Content Curators&rdquo; are all long-term staples of the Spotify brand, but Apple does the feature justice by making the music easy to sort through, and even easier to save to an outside playlist of your own design.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (28)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221413\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x673xFullSizeRender-28-608x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.xJjMvHwQWp.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:673px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For You&rdquo; is essentially a glorified &ldquo;Discover&rdquo; panel in&nbsp;Spotify, and both feature a rich set of suggested playlists that are generated based on the artists you&rsquo;ve liked or listened to previously. Here you can listen to all kinds of music that you might not ever find on your own, some put together by real humans at the Apple Music team, while the rest is procedurally calculated the more often you use the app.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (15)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221392\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x544xFullSizeRender-15.jpg.pagespeed.ic.sVJ8Eogl7e.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:544px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Subscription Pricing and Overall Value</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Apple knows they&rsquo;re late to the streaming game, and to make up for their lag in getting to the front of the pack, they&rsquo;re offering a free three&nbsp;month subscription to anyone who wants to sign up for the service.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (35)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221418\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x424xFullSizeRender-35.jpg.pagespeed.ic.2rCniCStua.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:424px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Spotify has responded in kind however, by giving new users the opportunity to sign up for three months of its own premium service for just $0.99 cents.

Except for the multiple-player aspect of D&amp;D, these pursuits were not &ldquo;passions from a common spring,&rdquo; to quote Poe.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I ever abided nerd stereotypes: I was never alone or felt outcast. I had a circle of friends who were similarly drawn to the exotica of pop culture (or, at least, what was considered pop culture at the time in northern Virginia)&mdash;Monty Python, post-punk music, comic books, slasher films, and videogames. We were a sizable clique. The terms&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:exchange ssm 4i,exchange ssm 4r,georgia,serif\">nerd</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:exchange ssm 4i,exchange ssm 4r,georgia,serif\">geek</span>&nbsp;were convenient shorthand used by other cliques to categorize us.

It comes from a term for &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s house&rdquo;&mdash;otaku live in their own, enclosed worlds. Or, at least, their lives follow patterns that are well outside the norm. Looking back, we were American otakus. (Of course, now all America is otaku&mdash;which I&rsquo;m going to get into shortly. But in order to do so, we&rsquo;re going to hang out in the &rsquo;80s.)</p>\n\n<p>I was too young to drive or hold a job. I was never going to play sports, and girls were an uncrackable code. So, yeah&mdash;I had time to collect every&nbsp;<cite>Star Wars</cite>&nbsp;action figure, learn the Three Laws of Robotics, memorize Roy Batty&rsquo;s speech from the end of&nbsp;<cite>Blade Runner</cite>, and classify each monster&rsquo;s abilities and weaknesses in TSR Hobbies&rsquo;&nbsp;<cite><a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 3px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(180, 231, 248); outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-transition: background 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.33, 0.66, 0.66, 1); transition: background 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.33, 0.66, 0.66, 1); color: inherit; text-decoration: none; box-shadow: rgb(180, 231, 248) 0px -5px 0px inset;\">Monster Manual</a></cite>. By 1987, my friends and I were waist-deep in the hot honey of adolescence. Money and cars and, hopefully, girls would follow, but not if we spent our free time learning the names of the bounty hunters&rsquo; ships in&nbsp;<cite>The Empire Strikes Back</cite>. So we each built our own otakuesque thought-palace, which we crammed with facts and nonsense&mdash;only now, the thought-palace was nicely appointed, decorated neatly, the information laid out on deep mahogany shelves or framed in gilt. What once set us apart, we hoped, would become a lovable quirk.</p>\n\n<p>Our respective nerdery took on various forms: One friend was the first to get his hands on early bootlegs of Asian action flicks by Tsui Hark and John Woo, and he never looked back. Another started reading William Gibson and peppered his conversations with cryptic (and alluring) references to &ldquo;cyberspace.&rdquo; I was ground zero for the &ldquo;new wave&rdquo; of mainstream superhero comics&mdash;which meant being right there for Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Neil Gaiman. And like my music-obsessed pals, who passed around the cassette of Guns n&rsquo; Roses&rsquo;&nbsp;<cite>Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide</cite>&nbsp;and were thus prepared for the shock wave of&nbsp;<cite><a href=\"http://www.notquitegnr.com/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 3px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(180, 231, 248); outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-transition: background 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.33, 0.66, 0.66, 1); transition: background 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.33, 0.66, 0.66, 1); color: inherit; text-decoration: none; box-shadow: rgb(180, 231, 248) 0px -5px 0px inset;\">Appetite for Destruction</a></cite>, I&rsquo;d devoured Moore&rsquo;s run on&nbsp;<cite>Swamp Thing</cite>&nbsp;and thus eased nicely into his&nbsp;<cite>Watchmen</cite>.

And I&rsquo;d consumed so many single-issue guest-writing stints of Gaiman&rsquo;s that when he was finally given&nbsp;<cite>The Sandman</cite>&nbsp;title all to himself, I was first in line and knew the language.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, there&rsquo;s a chilly thrill in moving with the herd while quietly being tuned in to something dark, complicated, and unknown just beneath the topsoil of popularity. Something about which, while we moved&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:exchange ssm 4i,exchange ssm 4r,georgia,serif\">with</span>the herd, we could share a wink and a nod with two or three other similarly connected herdlings.</p>\n\n<p>When our coworkers nodded along to Springsteen and Madonna songs at the local Bennigan&rsquo;s, my select friends and I would quietly trade out-of-context lines from&nbsp;<cite>Monty Python</cite>&nbsp;sketches&mdash;a thieves&rsquo; cant, a code language used for identification. We needed it, too, because the essence of our culture&mdash;our &ldquo;escape hatch&rdquo; culture&mdash;would begin to change in 1987.</p>\n\n<p>That was the year the final issue of&nbsp;<cite>Watchmen</cite>&nbsp;came out, in October. After that, it seemed like everything that was part of my otaku world was out in the open and up for grabs, if only out of context. I wasn&rsquo;t seeing the hard line between &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; and &ldquo;normals&rdquo; anymore. It was the last year that a T-shirt or music preference or pastime (Dungeons &amp; Dragons had long since lost its dangerous, Satanic, suicide-inducing street cred) could set you apart from the surface dwellers. Pretty soon, being the only person who was into something didn&rsquo;t make you outcast; it made you ahead of the curve and someone people were quicker to befriend than shun. Ironically, surface dwellers began repurposing the symbols and phrases and tokens of the erstwhile outcast underground.</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to now:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/bobafett/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 3px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(180, 231, 248); outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-transition: background 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.33, 0.66, 0.66, 1); transition: background 0.15s cubic-bezier(0.33, 0.66, 0.66, 1); color: inherit; text-decoration: none; box-shadow: rgb(180, 231, 248) 0px -5px 0px inset;\">Boba Fett&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;helmet emblazoned on sleeveless T-shirts worn by gym douches hefting dumbbells.

These kinds FCC documents used to be a rich source for people looking to learn about what gadgets were coming soon, but in recent years both those companies and the FCC have learned to lock up actual product photos under confidentiality agreements. Nevertheless, there are still details to be found amongst the tests, which require companies to disclose whether or not the radios inside these gadgets are safe for use around humans. Thus, we know that the device with the FCC ID&nbsp;A4R-GG1 supports various Wi-Fi bands and Bluetooth.</p>\n\n<p><q>GLASS IS COMING BACK</q></p>\n\n<p>But more interestingly, these documents also require that companies disclose where the FCC label will appear and what it will look like. And in this case, Google is taking advantage of the&nbsp;2014 E-Label act, which lets companies bury those labels away in the settings instead of printing them on the device itself. So instead of speculating about the shape of the device based on the size and position of a sticker, we get to speculate on the software of the device. Here, the GG1&#39;s documentation also gives us details: it&#39;s going to appear on a particularly Glass-like rectangular display and it&#39;s available on a submenu that requires users to &quot;scroll left and right&quot; &mdash; the scrolling directions used on the last version of Glass.</p>\n\n<p>Does all that add up to solid proof that the GG1 is the next version of Glass and that it will be coming out in 2015? Let&#39;s say it adds up to a solid &quot;maybe,&quot; since FCC documents rarely provide anything that definitive. But it certainly seems like Google is intent on taking another swing at convincing consumers they will want a computer on their face.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Source:&nbsp;http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/3/8889271/gg1-new-google-glass-fcc-tests</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-03 14:37:18',NULL,NULL,NULL),

The other major streaming music services stick with what&#39;s known as asynchronous, tailored radio -- that is, the hip-hop station you play on Pandora will be different than the hip-hop station I&#39;m listening to at the same time. Beats 1 will play the same music, with the same DJ commentary and curation, at the same time for everyone worldwide.</span></h3>\n\n<p>Apple Music differs from rivals by having a live worldwide radio station, a platform for artists to interact with fans and the ability to control the experience with voice commands.</p>\n\n<p>The second is Connect. The section lets artists share lyrics, backstage photos, songs and videos directly with fans and get their feedback. Musicians and fans can interact -- listeners can comment and artists can respond, plus anything posted is shareable on Messages, Facebook, Twitter and email. Though other subscription services let artists use the platforms to reach fans, Connect is the most elaborate and dedicated platform so far.</p>\n\n<p>The last is Siri integration. It&#39;s more consumer-focused than Connect, which holds the most appeal for artists as a way to reach fans, and it&#39;s more engaging than Beats 1, which is designed to be something you can play and just lean back to hear for a while.</p>\n\n<p>Music voice commands aren&#39;t unique to Apple Music. Google Now, the voice recognition element to Google&#39;s&nbsp;Android&nbsp;mobile operating system, allows users to perform simple commands like playing the specific song or pausing a track, but won&#39;t respond to more conversational requests like &quot;play the song from the movie &#39;Boyhood.&#39;&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Amazon introduced its voice-activated, Internet-connected wireless speaker Echo last year, and it is shipping the device to consumers widely starting next month. It can play specific songs from the Prime Music service that is part of Amazon&#39;s $99-a-year membership program, and it will spin up stations you&#39;ve created on Pandora or iHeart Radio if you link an account.</p>\n\n<p>But Siri&#39;s range of commands appear to be more sophisticated. And Echo stays in your home, while Siri follows you on your smartphone. That&#39;s a key point since streaming music services routinely report that most of their listening is on mobile devices.</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-03 06:37:23',NULL,NULL,NULL),

It is supposedly based on a device that was originally announced at Mobile World Congress back in March, and back then the best image we had to go off of was a low-resolution snapshot of the device being held up on stage. Now, Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) has posted a high-resolution render of the device, codenamed Venice, to Twitter.',NULL,'<p>It reveals the aforementioned display, curved at the sides like the&nbsp;Samsung&nbsp;Galaxy S6 Edge. There&#39;s a speaker at the bottom, and if you look closely at the last photo you can see that the basic design mostly matches up. It looks as though BlackBerry has chosen to excise dedicated Send and End keys &mdash; presumably because the device is now going to run Android instead of BlackBerry 10. It also seem possible that there&#39;s still a keyboard scurried away underneath that screen. The one other notable thing about Blass&#39; image is that it has Google app icons strewn about &mdash; which should mean that it has full access to&nbsp;Google&#39;s&nbsp;suite of apps and services. Blass also claims that the&nbsp;Venice will be coming to AT&amp;T.</p>\n\n<p>Last month,&nbsp;Reuters originally reported&nbsp;that BlackBerry would make the switch to Android. If this render proves accurate (and Blass has a long history of posting accurate leaks), it might well be coming soon. It&#39;s been a very long time since there&#39;s been a decent Android device with a physical keyboard and an even longer time since there&#39;s been a vertical sliding phone with a physical keyboard.

It’s cube-shaped and measures less than 1.5 inches long on every side. It shoots 1440p video at 30 frames per second, 1080p up to 60 frames per second, and 720p up to 100 frames per second. It’s waterproof up to 10 meters so it doesn’t require a bulky housing, which made it the perfect camera to stick on the hand that I was using on top of my paddle. It got the shot.','0','<p>The Session is extremely simple to use: you start and stop it with just one press of a button. In fact, the Session only has two buttons. The main one is a red, circular button found on the top side of the camera. Tap it, and the Session turns on and starts recording. Tap it again to stop recording, and the Session turns off. YOU OPERATE THE SESSION WITH ONE BUTTON, AND IT HELPS SAVE BATTERY This helps with battery life &mdash; a problem GoPro has long battled with its cameras. The Session&rsquo;s internal battery should last between one to two hours running consistently, but turning it on and off each time stretches the battery life much further. When I started the hour-and-a-half rafting trip, the Session had two-thirds of its battery life remaining, and by the end, it had outlasted a fully charged Hero 4 Black and Hero+ LCD. A 3-second press-and-hold on the main button will trigger a time-lapse photo mode. If you want to shoot single or burst photos, however, you have to change to these modes in the GoPro app. The only other button on the Session is for turning the camera&rsquo;s Wi-Fi on and off.</p>\n\n<div class=\"m-feature__body\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;\">\n<div class=\"m-photo-essay\" id=\"gallery8663426\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; clear: both;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<p>In fact, to change any settings on the Session, you have to use GoPro&rsquo;s app or the included Wi-Fi remote.

But GoPro has improved the ease of its on-camera menu system over the years, so if you&rsquo;ve gotten used to changing your settings on the fly, it could take some time to acclimate to the Session.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzMRr5eTtho\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of the Session&rsquo;s small size is how much harder it is to notice, no matter where you mount it. GoPro has also slimmed down its cameras over the years &mdash; the Hero 4 Black and Silver, in particular, are very light and small &mdash; but when you snap them into a housing and mount them to a helmet or to your wrist, you definitely still feel them when you&rsquo;re moving around.</p>\n\n<p>THE HERO 4 SESSION IS WATERPROOF OUT OF THE BOX</p>\n\n<p>The Session, on the other hand, is waterproof out of the box. It does use a small skeleton case (much like the&nbsp;frame mount&nbsp;the company sells for its bigger Hero cameras, but cubed) in order to attach it to the various mounts. I mounted it to my hand during our rafting trip and could barely feel it as we sped down the river. A bigger Hero 4 stuck inside a waterproof housing would have been much more cumbersome.</p>\n\n<p>Ditching the need for a housing also solves another long-standing problem with GoPro&#39;s cameras: the audio. The Session has two microphones &mdash; one on the front, and one on the back &mdash; and it dynamically switches between them to reduces wind noise. They never get muffled, and they&#39;re built to drain liquid fast, so the audio even sounds good when the camera comes out from underwater.</p>\n\n<p>As small as it looks on its own, when you place a Session next to a naked Hero 4 Black or Silver, they don&rsquo;t look that much different. Put them in their various mounts and cases, though, and you can&rsquo;t help but notice how much space the Session saves you.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\n <li><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazy-loaded vox-lazy-load\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TyN7o130L9ypmITADe__C0fhIk=/1020x0/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3847354/gopro-hero-4-session-03055.0.png\" style=\"border:0px;

The developers put each smartwatch to the same test, swimming four full lengths of the London Aquatic Centre&#39;s 50 meter pool. The test proved successful, with the Apple Watch mirroring the Pebble&#39;s results of a four lap, 200 meter swim. Apple&#39;s smartwatch even continued to measure heart rate successfully, raising from an initial 88bpm to 138bpm immediately after the test finished.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(4, 20, 39)\">The only downside for the app is that the Apple Watch experiences a tiny bit of lag when waking it up to check out lap times, the developers explaining that only when the screen is awake can the app run through the data samples collected from the swim and take a few seconds to parse through the information and display it on screen. Elsewhere, the swimming data isn&#39;t locked into the app, all of the workout and heart rate information getting delivered to HealthKit like any other workout and adding to a user&#39;s daily exercise and move goals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<div id=\"video-wrapper\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; zoom: 1; width: 560px; max-width: 100%;\">\n<div id=\"video-container\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 25px 0px 315px; box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; zoom: 1; position: relative; height: 0px; overflow: hidden; text-align: center;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1j2ZgcdkAvA?rel=0\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 560px; height: 340px;\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\n</div>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(4, 20, 39)\">Of course, even though the app works, the developers are still referring to it as an &quot;interesting technology demo,&quot; seeing that App Store Guidelines will immediately shut it down for encouraging users to use the Watch &quot;in a way that may cause damage to the device.&quot; In the end, the app&#39;s creators just hope that Apple hears the calls for a fully-waterproof smartwatch and includes such features in the device&#39;s next generation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>We really hope that Apple see the demand for an official, fully waterproofed Apple Watch. Once that is available, we&rsquo;ll be able to ship a fully featured swimming app. In the mean time, it would be great to see swimming become a first class citizen in the Apple Health and Activities apps.

But a quick check of the source code on Instagram&#39;s web view reveals that new photos uploaded to it are being saved in 1080px resolution, likely in preparation to making a full and public switch to the greater size in the coming days or weeks. We have reached out to Instagram to find out more. The company&#39;s last comments on the matter indicated that it neither uploads nor stores images at any greater resolution that its standard 640 x 640, so this is clearly a new development.</p>\n\n<p>NOT YET OFFICIAL, BUT VERY DEFINITELY REAL: 1080 X 1080 INSTAGRAMS</p>\n\n<p><em>Verge</em>&nbsp;reader Alejandro de la Torre was among the first to spot the larger Instagrams, stumbling upon the bigger preview when he received a link&nbsp;via<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5445864/telegram-messenger-hottest-app-in-the-world\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(250, 75, 42); text-decoration: none; background: transparent;\"> </a>Telegram.

It&#39;s too soon to say whether Instagram&#39;s persistent issue of over-compressing images coming from its Android app has been addressed, but both Android and iOS uploads are being stored in the higher res now. Check out a few of our latest posts on Instagram below, accompanied by their larger, more beautiful versions.</p>\n\n<p>To uncover your own 1080px photos, use a desktop browser like Chrome or Firefox to open up an Instagram photo page&#39;s source HTML code, then search for &quot;.jpg&quot; within it.

In the experiment which found discrimination between male and female users for example, the researchers say it could be Google&#39;s fault for targeting specific genders, or the advertisers&#39; fault for engineering such targeting. &quot;For these reasons, we cannot claim that Google has violated its policies,&quot; conclude the researchers. &quot;In fact, we consider it more likely that Google has lost control over its massive, automated advertising system.&quot; They add that &quot;even without advertisers placing inappropriate bids, large-scale machine learning can behave in unexpected ways.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Source:&nbsp;http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/7/8905037/google-ad-discrimination-adfisher</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-07 11:37:24',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Apple Music runs at a slightly lower 256kbps, but it uses a better encoding scheme, AAC, than Spotify&#39;s MP3 and Ogg Vorbis.</p>\n\n<p>But what does this all actually mean in the real world? We wanted to find out, so we put a bunch of Vox Media staff in front of the camera for a blind test between Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music.</p>\n\n<p>The methodology was straightforward: subjects listened to the same segment of the same song back-to-back on all three services set to their maximum streaming bitrates. We used Sony&#39;s MDR-7506 headphones &mdash; selected for their popularity, neutral sound, and non-outrageous price tag &mdash; paired to an iPhone 6 Plus. Subjects judged a total of three songs covering a spectrum of genres and audio characteristics: Kendrick Lamar&#39;s &quot;Complexion (A Zulu Love),&quot; St. Vincent&#39;s &quot;Digital Witness,&quot; and Aaron Copland&#39;s &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; off the&nbsp;<em>Copland Conducts Copland</em>&nbsp;compilation. After listening to each song, we asked them to just say whatever was on their mind &mdash; if one service sounded notably better, notably worse, or if all three were about the same.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>THE RESULTS WERE VERY, VERY SURPRISING TO ME</strong></p>\n\n<p>The results were very, very surprising to me. It was generally random across the board, though Spotify fared slightly worse than Apple Music and Tidal overall. In roughly 29 percent of the tests, subjects couldn&#39;t tell any notable difference at all. Tidal &mdash; which wants you to pay more for lossless quality &mdash; most definitely didn&#39;t take the crown, and in several cases, subjects actually identified it as the worst-sounding of the three.</p>\n\n<p>What are the takeaways? Having been a longtime Tidal subscriber and run blind tests on my laptop between Tidal and Spotify in the past, it seems possible that the difference in quality is particularly irrelevant when you&#39;re using your phone &mdash; maybe it&#39;s one thing to use better components, headphones, and speakers, but a phone&#39;s hardware creates a baseline that renders Tidal&#39;s advantage totally useless. (That&#39;s good news if you mostly listen to streaming music on your phone, since Tidal&#39;s lossless service is $10 more per month.)</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, remember that St. Vincent likes crunchy horns.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n\n<p>http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/7/8872115/apple-music-tidal-spotify-audio-quality-test</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-07 06:37:20',NULL,NULL,NULL),

While researching the sample, we observed that while it contained many characteristics of adware, and indeed embeds a popular adware library within it, a number of overtly malicious activities were also discovered, which we believe characterizes this family as being malware, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Collecting sensitive information from users</li>\n  <li>Propagating itself via SMS message</li>\n <li>Potentially pushing fraudulent advertisements</li>\n  <li>Ability to execute additional payloads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Gunpoder targets Android users in at least 13 different countries, including Iraq, Thailand, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Russia, France, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Italy, the United States, and Spain. One interesting observation from the reverse engineering of Gunpoder is that this new Android family only propagates among users outside of China.</p>\n\n<p>Unit 42 investigated Gunpoder using the Palo Alto Networks&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paloaltonetworks.com/autofocus\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(112, 144, 27); background-repeat: no-repeat;\" target=\"_blank\">AutoFocus</a>&nbsp;service, and released protections for users of WildFire, Threat Prevention and Mobile Security Manager for all currently known Gunpoder variants. Thanks to Palo Alto Networks unique prevention capabilities across the attack lifecycle, future members of the Gunpoder malware family could also potentially be blocked.</p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3>Evading Detection</h3>\n\n<p>By examining the reverse-engineered samples, we found the malware author applied several unique techniques to evade antivirus detection:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Gunpoder samples include aggressive advertisement libraries, such as Airpush, within the samples. Those ad libraries are easily detected and may also include aggressive behaviors. The malware samples successfully use these advertisement libraries to hide malicious behaviors from detection by antivirus engines. While antivirus engines may flag Gunpoder as being adware, by not flagging it as being overtly malicious, most engines will not prevent Gunpoder from executing. Figure 1 shows the VirusTotal scan results on one sample.</li>\n <li>Users who have executed Gunpoder are shown a notification that includes the Airpush library. We believe the notification was intentionally added in order to use the Airpush library as a scapegoat.</li>\n <li>Gunpoder samples embed malicious code within popular Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator games, which are based on an open source game framework (http://sourceforge.net/p/nesoid/code/ci/master/tree/). Palo Alto Networks has witnessed a trend of malware authors re-packaging open source Android applications with malicious code. Gonpoder makes use of this technique, which makes it difficult to distinguish malicious code when performing static analysis.</li>\n <li>Gunpoder targets users not residing in China. Samples observed support online payments, including PayPal, Skrill, Xsolla and CYPay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gunpoder-1.png\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(112, 144, 27); background-repeat: no-repeat;\"><img alt=\"gunpoder 1\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-9608\" src=\"http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gunpoder-1-500x528.png\" style=\"background-repeat:no-repeat; border:0px; display:block; height:528px; margin:0px; outline:0px; padding:0px; width:500px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>\n\n<p>http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/new-android-malware-family-evades-antivirus-detection-by-using-popular-ad-libraries/</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-08 06:37:29',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Now the 28-year-old New York brand strategist favors any of the six messaging apps on his phone.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When you message someone, there&rsquo;s more of an expectation that they&rsquo;ll write back,&rdquo; Mr. Pak says. &ldquo;Posting on Facebook is like taping a piece of paper on a friend&rsquo;s door and hoping they see it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Facebook Inc. popularized the notion of an online social network a decade ago. Now, the rapid rise of messaging services is changing social networking, as users increasingly communicate one-to-one, rather than the one-to-many more common on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Six of the world&rsquo;s 10 most-used apps are messaging services, according to data startup Quettra. On average, messaging apps are used an average of almost nine times a day, compared with 1.9 for all apps, according to the Flurry mobile-analytics unit of Yahoo Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Inside Facebook, Deutsche Bank estimates that users tap its WhatsApp and Messenger texting apps 25 to 30 times a day, compared with 15 for the main Facebook feed. Analysts expect WhatsApp to reach a billion users by early next year, seven years after it began&mdash;two years faster than Facebook itself hit that mark.</p>\n\n<p>Students of communication say the growth of messaging apps is natural, because one-to-one chats more closely mirror how people interact every day. Users aren&rsquo;t abandoning Facebook, but its purpose has changed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;WhatsApp is filling a more primary need than social media&rdquo; sites like Facebook and Twitter, said&nbsp;Scott Campbell,&nbsp;professor of mobile communications at the University of Michigan. &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s something kind of evolutionary about it, something kind of clannish.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Facebook itself has embraced the trend. Beyond acquiring WhatsApp for $22 billion in 2014, it also developed and promoted Messenger, which now boasts more than 700 million users.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We believe that messaging, it&rsquo;s one of the few things that people actually do more than social networking,&rdquo; Facebook founder and Chief Executive&nbsp;<a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/Z/Mark-Zuckerberg/408\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>&nbsp;said during a public question-and-answer session last year.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the shift poses risks for Facebook, which makes money by inserting advertising in users&rsquo; &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; of posts by their friends. Many messaging apps don&rsquo;t show messages in a similar stream, making it more challenging to display ads.</p>\n\n<p>Some Asian messaging services generate revenue in other ways. Roughly 550 million people in China turn to&nbsp;<a class=\"company-name\" href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/TCEHY\" style=\"margin: 0px 4px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">WeChat</a>&nbsp;each month to keep tabs on friends, play mobile games and watch NBA games, with parent&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/TCEHY\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">Tencent Holdings</a>&nbsp;Ltd.&nbsp;getting a cut when users make purchases of real or virtual goods. It also places ads in its &ldquo;Moments&rdquo; feed, which is similar to Facebook&rsquo;s news feed.</p>\n\n<p>Line, which is popular in Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, makes money through in-app purchases and by selling packs of online stickers for about $1.99 apiece to its 205 million monthly active users.</p>\n\n<p>So far, such initiatives don&rsquo;t generate anywhere near as much revenue as Facebook ads. Line, WeChat and Korea&rsquo;s KakaoTalk collect $1.50 to $3 a year per monthly active user, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst&nbsp;Mark Mahaney.&nbsp;That is less than one-third of Facebook&rsquo;s $9.45 in revenue per monthly user in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook hinted at future plans in March when it opened Messenger to outside developers who made photo and video apps for the messaging platform. It also added a feature to allow users to track orders from online retailers Zulily Inc. and Everlane. For now, none of those features generate revenue.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/M/David-Marcus/6930\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">David Marcus</a>,&nbsp;head of Messenger, says Facebook understands the challenge and must &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; the Asian messaging apps.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Right now, we make no money on Messenger,&rdquo; Mr. Marcus said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re hopeful that over time we&rsquo;ll find out a really good business model for Messenger and one that&rsquo;s very sustainable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, Facebook isn&#39;t going away. Some 1.44 billion people visit Facebook at least once a month. The social network is adding tens of millions of users each month, many in developing countries who see Facebook as &ldquo;the Internet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>On average, though, Facebook users are sharing less. Roughly 42% of Facebook users said they posted a status update or commented on the social network in the first quarter&mdash;down from 69% in the first quarter of 2013, according to surveys by market researcher GlobalWebIndex.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The rise of Messenger, WhatsApp and others is causing behaviors on &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; networks to become much more passive,&rdquo; said Jason Mander, head of trends for GlobalWebIndex. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not leaving sites like Facebook per se, but we are using them for fewer things.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Christie Silver, a 39-year-old freelance writer in Red Bank, N.J., used to discuss her political beliefs on Facebook. These days, she shares only news stories and pictures of her children. Ms. Silver says she stopped posting about her beliefs after one too many judgmental comments from Facebook friends. She now stays in touch with her husband and friend through texts on Google Hangouts.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use Facebook the way I used to,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When I look at the status updates that I put up six years ago, it was more about my state of mind.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Facebook&rsquo;s Mr. Marcus says social-media use is changing, but the number of users on Facebook, and the time they spend on the network are both increasing. &ldquo;So I think that&rsquo;s not a problem,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n\n<p>Some users are experimenting with messaging apps in ways that bend the one-to-one model, creating a hybrid form of communication.</p>\n\n<p>At Luther Burbank High School in Sacramento, Calif., teachers use WhatsApp to help non-English-speaking students learn the language. Most students already had the app, so teachers created a group chat for the class. Teachers pose a daily question in English by text and audio message to the group, giving students until the morning to respond.</p>\n\n<p>Larry Ferlazzo, who has taught English for nonnative speakers for 11 years at the inner-city school, says WhatsApp lets students speak and write their answers. &ldquo;Both features are important for learners of a second language,&rdquo; he says.Mr. Ferlazzo says it would be challenging to use Facebook in a similar way. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to all &lsquo;friend&rsquo; everybody else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That might put unnecessary pressure on students to friend their teachers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Write to&nbsp;Deepa Seetharaman at&nbsp;<a class=\"icon \" href=\"mailto:Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px / 30px 30px no-repeat;\" target=\"_blank\">Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com</a></p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-09 05:37:44',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Unlike iOS 7 or 8, which introduced massive revisions to how the platform looked and worked under the hood, iOS 9 is a subtler update. Still, it does have a number of new features for the iPhone and iPad that should make the platform easier and more efficient to use.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s been available for developers to test for some time now, but if you&#39;re daring, Apple just released a public beta that anyone can install. Apple&#39;s beta software isn&rsquo;t like the some of the other beta software you may have used in that it&rsquo;s usually a &ldquo;true&rdquo; beta that still has bugs and crashes that can seriously keep you from relying on it from day to day. The company warns against installing it on your main device, and you should heed that advice. We&#39;ve gone ahead and bit the bullet and installed it on an iPhone 6 Plus and iPad Air 2. Unsurprisingly, there are a number of rough edges and wonky areas that Apple will likely clean up by the time this reaches final release in the fall. There are also a bunch of incompatibilities with third-party apps that haven&#39;t yet been updated to support the new platform. But overall, there&rsquo;s a lot to like, even in these early stages. Here are our early impressions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Look and feel</h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(68, 68, 68)\">Visually, iOS 9 doesn&#39;t look much different than iOS 8, and an untrained eye will have difficulty telling them apart at first. Apple has largely been tweaking and refining the look of iOS since version 7&rsquo;s major revamp two years ago, and iOS 9 does include some small changes. The most notable one is the system-wide use of Apple&rsquo;s own San Francisco font, which replaces the Helvetica Neue it used before. San Francisco first debuted on the Apple Watch this year, and it&rsquo;s a clean, readable font that works well at a variety of sizes. Most people probably won&rsquo;t be able to spot the difference between Helvetica Neue and San Francisco, but it is pleasant to look at.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(68, 68, 68)\">Other minor (or major, depending on who you ask) updates include proper casing in the virtual keyboard to denote lowercase or capital letters, a toolbar for Bluetooth keyboards that adds word prediction and quick cut / copy / paste tools, and a cascading cards system for recent apps. The new cascading cards system replaces the app thumbnails that scrolled left-to-right with a stacked layout that&#39;s oriented right-to-left. It works nicely on the iPad, which has a lot of screen space to work with, but on the smaller display of the iPhone, we prefer iOS 8&rsquo;s more static system that also offers quick access to recently used contacts. Apple could add back the quick-access contacts in later revisions of iOS 9, but for now, they aren&rsquo;t there. Mostly, the new system adds visual flair without much added functionality.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>What&#39;s next</h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(68, 68, 68)\">These are just a few of the highlight features of iOS 9, and there are certainly many more that we haven&#39;t covered in detail here. Little things, like better organization of the Notification Center, better support for Apple&#39;s new Music service, faster performance, the new Wallet app that replaces Passbook, better battery life, better security, and an improved way to handle system updates are all pretty small in their own merits, but add up to a better overall experience. Apple will be iterating on iOS 9 based on user feedback during this public beta trial, and there are some things that could certainly change before it launches widely this fall. Until then, it might be best just to sit back and wait, unless you have a secondary iOS device kicking around, of course.</span></p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-10 08:37:17',NULL,NULL,NULL),

But a product’s success or failure can often depend on one developer’s #UX sensitivity. #Firefox lead designer Philipp Sackl talks to us about what exactly developers need to know about UX.',NULL,'<p>Philipp Sackl:&nbsp;It depends. So in the past I&rsquo;ve worked with a variety of developers in different places and some of them care a lot about UX to the point they are challenging the UX people &ndash; are you sure this is a good idea? &ndash; And it&rsquo;s not always because it&rsquo;s hard to implement, but because they actually care about the user experience. So those were actually the most fun working environments so far.</p>\n\n<p>There are definitely a lot of developers out there that care a great deal about UX &ndash; I think particularly when you look at startup culture. When you look at people like&nbsp;Loren Brichter&nbsp;(the guy who invented &lsquo;pull to refresh&rsquo;), he&rsquo;s a developer. Other people like Marco Arment of Instapaper fame &ndash; he&rsquo;s a developer, just caring about the user side of things and polishing the application. So having both the UX person and the developer caring about the user experience is a dream team combination.</p>\n\n<p>But the second kind of developer is the one that tries to get out of the way, that doesn&rsquo;t care but also doesn&rsquo;t obstruct. And then I&rsquo;ve also encountered people in my life that just want to float, that just want to get things done the easiest possible way, rather than the right way for the user. And I think that&rsquo;s just bad development. They probably have a reason for doing that, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good space&nbsp;to be in.</p>\n\n<p>So how can companies motivate developers to care about UX? If there&rsquo;s a UX expert in the company, does that not promote the &ldquo;someone else will take care of it&rdquo; attitude?</p>\n\n<p>It has something to do with ownership. So in a given product, everyone from the marketing person, the developer, the UX person, the project manager &ndash; every person feels some kind of ownership about the product. And I think this naturally leads to conversations about how this is going to effect users, what the response will be like. So I think that&rsquo;s the best reason to care about UX.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">&ldquo;Caring about UX is job security.&rdquo;</h3>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s also other issues. When it really is about the company bottom line, then most of the time user success and user satisfaction correlates with the bottom line. So, caring about UX is job security. You&rsquo;re helping your product be successful and the successful product will keep you employed. That&rsquo;s an extreme case, but it still matters.</p>\n\n<p>Speed is obviously always a huge factor for developers. But at a recent Webinale talk you showed that it can sometimes pay to slow a product down to highlight its security and thereby build trust. How does this work?</p>\n\n<p>There are two things in play here. One is trust in general, and the other is security in particular. And they&rsquo;re very much interrelated. About trust in general &ndash; I think a lot of it depends really on what you usually call the &lsquo;look and feel&rsquo; of an application. Are there any rough edges? Are there any sudden jumps in the interface? Is there any yank? Is there anything that looks unfinished?</p>\n\n<p>So let&rsquo;s compare your website, product or application to a car. Are all the parts in the right place? Does it have any scratches on the surface? If you go to a car dealership and you have a giant scratch on the hood, that&rsquo;s not going to be a great value proposition. And this is essentially what happens when you see an application and it doesn&rsquo;t react to a click, for example.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jaxenter.com/how-to-improve-ux-with-service-design-tools-107338.html\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(66, 139, 202); text-decoration: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1em; vertical-align: baseline; background: 0px 0px;\" target=\"_blank\">How to improve UX with service design tools</a></p>\n\n<p>About the issue of security and speed in general &ndash; there&rsquo;s kind of a trade-off. Security is perceived by many people as something that needs to be done actively. So, they&rsquo;re asking the application &lsquo;what are you doing to make me secure?&rsquo; And the thing is, on a technical level, all that crypto and the SSL handshake stuff, that usually never takes long. SSL handshakes take milliseconds. But to the user that&rsquo;s completely invisible. It&rsquo;s something that they never see. And if they&rsquo;re not hugely technical then they&rsquo;re just not going to know that the application is doing anything to keep them secure.</p>\n\n<p>So in some cases it might make sense to have a deliberate tradeoff to actually show some messaging or reinforcement of this application being secure, instead of making it simply as fast as possible. Now this is not a general rule that you can always apply. You shouldn&rsquo;t make every tap display &lsquo;securely managing your tap&rsquo; &ndash; that would probably drive people crazy. But in those crucial moments when it really is about information being safe, when you&rsquo;re filling in a huge tax form, for example, when you&rsquo;re entering all your personal information and information about your income, then it probably makes sense to do something to reinforce the security principle at that point.</p>\n\n<p>What advice would you offer developers that want everyday work results in good UX?</p>\n\n<p>I think probably the single best thing that you can do is watch people using the product you&rsquo;re building, if this at all possible. If you&rsquo;re building an app, go to a coffee shop, buy someone a coffee and ask them to just use the app while you look over their shoulder. Ask family members, just anyone you can grab, ask them not just for feedback, but just for the opportunity to watch them do stuff. Because they&rsquo;re probably going to do it differently.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">&ldquo;Most of us&nbsp;in the tech industry are&nbsp;living in a bubble&rdquo;</h3>\n\n<p>And the reason I think this is so important is because most&nbsp;of us&nbsp;in the tech industry (and that includes designers like me) are&nbsp;living in a bubble. We have all these very elaborate concepts about how the world works, how technology works, that just aren&rsquo;t the way most people are living it. So exposing yourself to that reality is the single most important thing you can do to become more sensitive to these issues.</p>\n\n<p>Then of course the next step would be to find out how you can change that with whatever I&rsquo;m doing. And if you can&rsquo;t (because maybe you&rsquo;re a back-end engineer and can&rsquo;t do much in the front-end) then at least you can bring it up with your team. Ideally you&rsquo;ll also have a culture at your company where the general staff is receptive to this kind of feedback, that obviously makes it easier. Otherwise it becomes a question of lobbying and making people aware and getting people to care.</p>\n\n<p>Firefox saw a massive usage growth after it introduced major UX improvements in the recent Australis design update. And some users even thought the browser felt faster. How did you manage this?</p>\n\n<p>So the extent of it was not something we expected. I think the really interesting thing there is these halo effects that are happening with products that are perceived to have higher quality, like I talked about earlier. If you have a high-quality product that also feels high quality then all these other positive attributes start grouping around it.</p>\n\n<p>If a product feels high-quality and dependable, then it also feels more secure and, in our case, even faster to a lot of users. We didn&rsquo;t design for it to feel faster in terms of pageload (well, we&rsquo;re always designing for that, but we didn&rsquo;t do it for that release). So we were a little surprised when that happened. But once you see these kinds of connections, then you can start using them deliberately. And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do more of in the future.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n\n<p>http://jaxenter.com/how-ux-can-help-you-keep-your-job-as-a-developer-118009.html?utm_content=bufferd67e2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-12 13:37:44',NULL,NULL,NULL),

At least, that\'s what I tell people I do for a living, because it\'s what most people understand.\n\nThe truth is, I am a front-end developer. If you read this blog with any sort of regularity, then I don\'t even need to bother explaining that job title.','0','<p>Or do I?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I get a sense that we likely have different definitions for what it means to be a front-end developer. I bet the job description you would write for me varies a ton from what I actually do on a day-to-day basis. You may even expect that I know certain programming languages that I, in fact, do not.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, some of you may not consider me a developer at all, or a poser at best. Many hold the opinion that front-end development is not development at all. That used to hurt my feelings.</p>\n\n<p>I found myself recalling those hurt feelings recently when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/tales-of-a-non-unicorn-a-story-about-the-trouble-with-job-titles-and-descriptions/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 114, 185); border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent;\">Lara Schenck shared her story</a>&nbsp;of missing out on a UX job because she wasn&#39;t familiar with the programming test&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 114, 185); border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent;\">FizzBuzz</a>. The fact that she didn&#39;t get the job didn&#39;t bother me as much as the number of snarky comments her story got, mostly from people who don&#39;t consider front-end development a form of development.</p>\n\n<h3>My Tale of Being a Non-Unicorn</h3>\n\n<p>I design for the web, and often code those designs into the stuff that people interact with on the front end.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t always write code. In fact, I never thought I would ever write a single line of it when I first started designing sites in 2005. Designers worked in Photoshop and developers worked in whatever they worked in &mdash; I didn&#39;t know because it never seemed relevant to ask. We were all cogs in the machine, at least at some of the places I worked at.</p>\n\n<p>But over time, I found myself not only asking those questions, but trying to answer them for myself because it became a necessity. If my designs were not pixel perfect (remember when&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;was a thing?) on the screen at the end of the day, I wanted to know why. In the end, that led to learning HTML, which led to CSS, which led to jQuery, which led to JavaScript. I even found myself gaining a basic understanding of PHP solely for the ability to write WordPress filters.</p>\n\n<p>Am I excellent at all of the above? Absolutely not. I definitely get by, but I still find myself navigating Stack Overflow forums for what might be totally obvious answers to other developers.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the abridged story of how I became a front-end developer. Or front end designer. Or just plain designer. Whatever.</p>\n\n<h3>But You&#39;re Still Not a Developer!</h3>\n\n<p>This is where I get a little hippie-dippy on things because I think the role of development is an evolving concept. Is development just about programming? Or can&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/development-is-design/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 114, 185); border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent;\">development be design</a>&nbsp;as well? Because, if it&#39;s all about programming, then I&#39;m definitely not a developer.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that development has a lot to do with both design and programming. They&#39;re not mutually exclusive. Trying to divide them in a cage match over who owns the term is as useless as Santa Cruz and Huntington Beach fighting over<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_City,_USA\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 114, 185); border-bottom-width: 2px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent;\">Surf City, USA</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>How I Cope With the Criticism</h3>\n\n<p>I tend to deal with the criticism that front end development is not &quot;real&quot; development simply by not worrying about semantics. Honestly, I don&#39;t care what people think my job title is. In some circles, I am seen as the designer. In other circles, I&#39;m seen as the developer (for lack of a better word, I guess). Heck, as I type this, Chris Coyier sees me as the writer. Where does that fit into anything?</p>\n\n<p>I called myself a web designer at the beginning of this post and that is my default answer for what I do. Some of my work happens to involve designing layouts. Some of it happens to involve coding prototypes. Some of it even requires me to write functions. All those pieces are what work together to develop a website, which is what I&#39;m trying to do at the end of the day regardless of if I am seen as a designer or a developer.</p>\n\n<h3>Where Do We Go From Here?</h3>\n\n<p>First off, let&#39;s make love and not war. I&#39;m not really a fan of name-calling and snarky online comments because it&#39;s unproductive.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I think the door is wide open to talk honestly about the need for better job descriptions. The point of Lara&#39;s post is not that FizzBuzz is the epitome of evil, but that the job she interviewed for was out of scope from what was written in the job description.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, let&#39;s accept that our industry changes rapidly and that includes the scope of the work we do. We need to have an expansive and evolving baseline understanding for what front-end development encompasses and that the meaning of *development* may shift from time to time or even project to project.</p>\n\n<p>OK, time to stop writing and start designing.

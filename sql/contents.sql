Hard to imagine you reading a story about enterprise software if it wasn&rsquo;t a part of your working life. Then again, Slack has always been a little weird like that. A year and a half ago, no one had ever heard of it. A few days later, everyone you knew was using it.</p>\n','<p>Okay, not&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>. But all the startups had taken their workplace chatter there, and then the media did, too. And once something is being used by all of the startups and all of the media, it begins to feel inevitable and then necessary. (This is the entire story of Twitter.)</p>\n\n<p>300,000 OF SLACK&#39;S 1.1 MILLION USERS USE THE PAID VERSION</p>\n\n<p>Of Slack&rsquo;s 1.1 million users, 300,000 use the paid version. Employers will pay between $6.67 and $48 a month per user for the hottest Slack features, such as a searchable archive with unlimited messages ($6.67 a month, if billed annually); an archive of everything you have ever typed, for compliance purposes ($12.50 a month, billed annually) and &quot;a configurable email ingestion service,&quot; $48, which sounds disgusting.</p>\n\n<p>Slack projects its revenues around $25 million this year. It has raised $340 million, and&nbsp;is valued at $2.8 billion. At least, that&rsquo;s how much it was worth in April. Who knows what it would be valued at today. Pick any number you like &mdash; $8 billion, say. Slack will probably be worth that at some point. November, maybe?</p>\n\n<p>SLACK WILL GENERATE REVENUES OF $25 MILLION THIS YEAR</p>\n\n<p>Some people use Slack for free. There is a writers&rsquo; Slack, and an LGBTQ Slack, and a Slack for former Twitter employees, who hang out in Slack all day long and LOL at the day&rsquo;s Twitter news.&nbsp;There is ChitCats, &quot;a place to discover and join private Slack groups,&quot; where people vote on Slacks, Reddit-style.</p>\n\n<p>This week a group named Free Code Camp sent me an email with the promising subject line &quot;Slack is lying to its users.&quot; The founder of Free Code Camp, Quincy Larson, complained that while Slack promises it is free to an&nbsp;<em>unlimited</em>&nbsp;number of users, this week code campers reached the previously undocumented free Slack limit of 8,462 people. A spokeswoman for Slack said this: &quot;Slack plainly says about the free plan, &lsquo;We offer a free plan for small teams, casual users, and anyone who wants to evaluate Slack.&rsquo; Based on that, it&rsquo;s difficult to infer Slack would be an appropriate tool for use by a 10,000-person community.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Slack&rsquo;s&nbsp;pricing&nbsp;page&nbsp;really does say there are &quot;no limits on time or users,&quot; though, so at some point Slack will have to change the language there. It won&rsquo;t be that big of a deal.</p>\n\n<p>FREE UP TO 8,462 USERS</p>\n\n<p>Slack is successful because it integrates with other things &mdash; about 100 other things right now. Workplace chat apps are a dime a dozen, so as best as anyone can tell, it&rsquo;s these integrations that made Slack a big deal. For example, you can set up a chat room that tells you every time people mention your #brand on Twitter. (Your brand sucks!) Or you can set up a room that imports every picture that Beyonc&eacute; posts to Instagram. Or you can have Github do things in your Slack, if you are a code person. Slack users have set up 900,000 of these integrations so far, and they send 30 million messages a week.</p>\n\n<p>Slack is not perfect. Months ago, its founder, Stewart Butterfield, told me you would soon be able to leave emoji comments on Slack messages. For example, if someone said something poopy, you could comment with a poop emoji, and so could your co-workers, and in time you would return to view the poopy message, and it would have eight poops next to it. This hasn&rsquo;t shipped yet, and I for one would like to know what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>\n\n<p>Slack also leads employees to&nbsp;near-constant goofing around, whether by playing games of Jeopardy! or using Giphy to punctuate every sentence with random animations. John Herrman memorably called this &quot;mainstream work larping.&quot;&nbsp;Certainly you will observe people at your company who never have time for&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;but are incredibly active on Slack, hunting through every chat room in search of someone to banter with for a few more moments before returning to their TPS reports.</p>\n\n<p>A PERSISTENT LOW-LEVEL WORK ANXIETY THAT WILL HAUNT YOU UNTIL THE END OF TIME</p>\n\n<p>But you will also observe people who barely pay attention to Slack at all, and you will resent them for it, and at some point someone you work with who is terrible at Slack will be fired for not being &quot;a culture fit,&quot; and you&rsquo;ll understand that these two things are likely related. How much should you participate in Slack? What is the right amount of GIFs? These will add to the persistent, low-level work anxieties that you will carry around for the rest of your days.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, look at Google Docs. Until&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;recently &mdash; yesterday, maybe? &mdash; opening a Google Doc through Slack took three clicks. The first click opened a useless sidebar. The second click opened a browser tab that contained a link to the Google Doc in a format that looked exactly like the tab in the useless sidebar. Then you clicked&nbsp;<em>that</em>link and finally your Google Doc opened. I asked Slack to fix this on Twitter last week, and a couple people chimed in, and this morning when I went to open a Google Doc through Slack, it opened with a single click.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, 1.1 million people, $25 million, $2.8 billion. The numbers look big today. They won&rsquo;t tomorrow.</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-02 12:37:16',NULL,NULL,NULL),

','<p>What is an app? The term &ldquo;app&rdquo; is short for &ldquo;application&rdquo;. Within digital marketing, when we refer to an app, we are generally talking about a mobile application such as those that you, and millions of others, use every day on smart phones around the world, or a campaign application on your corporate Facebook page. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When strategically developed and targeted, custom Facebook applications can support your outbound and inbound marketing or business goals with trackable results. With a Facebook population of over 22 million across the Middle East there&rsquo;s no question that your audience is ready.</p>\n','<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<h4><span style=\"color:#2B7FE9\">Custom applications</span></h4>\n\n<p>By rolling out unique and engaging promotions across your social media channels, you give your company or brand the ability to engage with your target market in a real and meaningful manner, increasing reach of information and customer conversion.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of custom applications, is the ability to gather user data as part of the process. &nbsp;This data can then be used to stay in touch with your audience, to drive key business decisions and to help direct your marketing strategies.</p>\n\n<p>How many people within your customer base are between the ages of 25 and 34? How many of these customers are male or female? How many live in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia or the greater GCC area? Any number of questions can be posed and answered giving you incredible insight into your target market.</p>\n\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<h4><span style=\"color:#2B7FE9\">Keep it simple</span></h4>\n\n<p>We have rolled out a whole raft of custom applications for our customers, ranging from simple sign ups with custom landing pages, ensuring that your visitors are prompted to become a part of your community before being able to participate, through to fully customised treasure hunts, leading users to engage with each and every online and offline marketing channel available. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We have learnt that the key to a successful campaign is ensuring that, no matter how many channels you wish to activate, the barriers to entry are as few as possible and that requirements necessary to engage are as simple as possible.</p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h4><span style=\"color:#2B7FE9\">Return of investment</span></h4>\n\n<p>Of course, a core concept of digital and social media marketing is the ability to track and analyse your return on investment. We ensure that, for every custom campaign developed, we track all the key analytical touch points you would expect: How many people visited the page? How many users clicked on the links? How many users shared content? How many users converted into fans? etc.</p>\n\n<p>By comparing this information against details gathered either before or after the campaign, we are able to assign a baseline to your standard traffic and conversion, therefore assigning any gains to activities undertaken in association with your campaign. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For a clear example of an effective custom Facebook application, check out our case study on the &lsquo;Be A Part of Our History&rsquo; 2013 Porsche Boxster campaign.</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-06-29 11:06:13',9,NULL,NULL),

A law passed late last year requires all chauffeurs to hold costly professional licenses and insurance, which UberPop drivers are not obligated to obtain. French authorities have repeatedly&nbsp;called&nbsp;for a ban on the service, but Uber has appealed it in French courts and at the European Union.</p>\n\n<p><q>UBER SAYS SUSPENSION IS IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY</q></p>\n\n<p>The service had been allowed to continue during the appeals, but the French government has moved to crack down on it in recent days, after taxi unions staged a&nbsp;nationwide strike&nbsp;in protest of the service last week. This week, two Uber France executives were&nbsp;taken into police custody&nbsp;and later&nbsp;charged&nbsp;with operating an illegal taxi service. They are slated to go on trial in September.</p>\n\n<p>In its blog post, Uber France said it was suspending the service not because of ongoing legal disputes, but because of increased hostility between UberPop chauffeurs and taxi drivers across France. On at least&nbsp;two recent occasions&nbsp;in Strasbourg, taxi drivers posing as Uber customers reportedly ordered rides to remote areas and attacked Uber drivers, as part of an ambush operation. Other drivers reported being attacked and intimidated during last week&#39;s protests.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;These last weeks, the intimidations, mostly violent aggressions, or organized ambushes against drivers and UberPop customers have multiplied in France, due to an out-of-control minority of individuals,&quot; the company said in a French-language post. &quot;Uber does not wish to put any UberPop drivers and passengers at risk.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In an interview with&nbsp;<em>Le Monde</em>&nbsp;published prior to Uber&#39;s official announcement, Thibaud Simphal, general manager of Uber France, said the company also wanted to position itself &quot;in a spirit of appeasement, of dialogue with public powers, and to show that we take our responsibilities.&quot; Simphal was one of the executives charged this week, together with Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber&#39;s general manager for Western Europe.

They are all role models, their facebook and twitter pages are used to raise awareness of some really important issues.

Looking for a sign of the tech-influenced times? Regardless of how long they&#39;d been married, most couples (76%) say they would have preferred to register for an Ultra HD TV &ndash; a display that handles video that&#39;s four times the resolution of regular HDTVs &ndash; than a formal china place setting.</span></p>\n\n<p>More couples consider technology items appropriate for gift registries, according to a survey of brides and grooms commissioned by retailer&nbsp;Best Buy. Those married within the last five years were more likely to consider that OK (74% approved), but even 58% of couples who&#39;ve been married 20 years or more approved.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Technology is of course ever present today and couples are really starting to include these tools in their weddings &ndash; including their gift registries,&quot; said Wendy Fritz, head of gifting registry for Best Buy, which began its own registry in February. &quot;It&#39;s no longer about a fancy china place setting, it&#39;s about a flat screen TV for a new home or a digital camera for the honeymoon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Could they do it all over again, most couples married more than 20 years (75% of them) wish that they could have tech items on their registry. The most popular gift desires? A TV, camera or video camera, a tablet, smart thermostat and wireless sound system.</p>\n\n<p>Most of those surveyed (74%) said they would prefer a useful gift such as a tech product over a sentimental gift. For Best Buy&#39;s survey,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wakefieldresearch.com/\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 144, 229); text-decoration: none;\" title=\"http://www.wakefieldresearch.com/\">Wakefield Research</a>&nbsp;got input about wedding gifts from more than 1,000 brides and 1,000 grooms from May 29 to June 12, 2015.

The account tied to your phone will act as the default you&rsquo;ll use to register with the service, and all purchases (including your subscription), will be charged to the card you use in the iTunes App Store.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (1)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221384\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x534xFullSizeRender-1-623x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.aug2VR5PWm.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:534px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (4)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221381\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x540xFullSizeRender-4-616x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic._1q4fZDIoT.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:540px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Customizing the Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Once the account is cleared you&rsquo;ll be taken to a screen that asks you which genres you&rsquo;re interested in the most. With the genre chosen, a cloud of various artists will pour in. If you don&rsquo;t see anything that pops out at you on the first page, you can tap the button in the bottom right to spawn more artist bubbles in the cloud.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (6)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221379\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x549xFullSizeRender-6-606x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oj1auljP4l.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:549px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (5)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221380\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x563xFullSizeRender-5-591x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.0Et6EI_a0v.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:563px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Once you find an artist you like, you can tap it once for &ldquo;like&rdquo;, or twice for &ldquo;love&rdquo;, after which the artist will blow up its size accordingly. If you see any that you could do without, just hold down your finger on their name for three seconds, after which they&rsquo;ll be deleted from the list.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (7)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221389\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x678xFullSizeRender-7-604x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.gHzjcG3jbz.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:678px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is how Apple Music will start off by learning your preferences for everything &ndash; from what to play on the radio to what artists and albums are recommended during new release Tuesdays &ndash; so be as specific as you can to have the best possible chance of scoring a match in your general listening profile.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (14)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221393\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x572xFullSizeRender-14.jpg.pagespeed.ic.libh_PdV8M.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:572px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In case your suggestions&nbsp;don&rsquo;t seem to fit later on, you can always go back in and reset the artist cloud by finding the option in your settings menu.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>User Interface and Overall Feel</strong></h3>\n\n<p>On its face, Apple Music doesn&rsquo;t stray too far from the aesthetic that the company first established with the design overhaul in iOS 8. Clean, matte lines are accented by Apple&rsquo;s trademark white glow, and just like the lock screen, the text of whichever album you&rsquo;re viewing will take on the colors of the cover art for that extra little dose of immersion.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (30)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221411\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x680xFullSizeRender-30-602x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.HL_2RrIrv_.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:680px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, all the buttons you need are here, and none feel out of place from where they ended up. Skip tracks using the arrows, check a playlist using the &ldquo;chart&rdquo; button, and share with the same icon you&rsquo;d use to upload a photo from your camera roll.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (11)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221385\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x673xFullSizeRender-11-608x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.O2G0CXQCEg.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:673px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the My Music tab, you&rsquo;ll see all the songs you&rsquo;ve saved from radio using the hearted &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; icon, along with any music that&rsquo;s already been stored locally on the device.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"imageedit_5_3276744794\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221436\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/410x698ximageedit_5_3276744794-601x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.z3JZc4pQLG.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:698px; margin-left:-2px; width:410px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Connect to Your Artists</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Connect is Apple&rsquo;s answer to Spotify&rsquo;s &ldquo;Follow&rdquo; feature, which gives users the opportunity to not only see when their favorite artists have released new music or tour dates, but also get an inside look at what they&rsquo;re listening to on their own accounts.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (10)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221386\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x550xFullSizeRender-10-605x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.SGPW6sfFeo.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:550px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (9)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221387\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x552xFullSizeRender-9-603x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.bWeGFM03I1.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:552px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<p>If we had to give it to either side, for now the advantage would sneak slightly over to Apple Music. Connect is an improvement on Follow in almost every way, faulted only for the fact that it&rsquo;s the first thing you&rsquo;ll see if click on an artist from search and they have it enabled (instead of their actual music).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (27)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221402\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x677xFullSizeRender-27-605x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.GuD6InyS8w.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:677px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Radio and Available Music Library</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Both Spotify and Apple Music made the same deal with the record companies, and because neither are interested in stepping outside the bounds of copyright law, both have a nearly identical library of 30 million+ songs from all the same artists as the other. Apple has promised its service would feature exclusive albums from a select few artists such as Taylor Swift, though it&rsquo;s still too early to say whether there will actually be enough added content to justify the switch.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (31)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221410\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x479xFullSizeRender-31.jpg.pagespeed.ic.CP8CeTd9JC.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:479px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Radio (found in the &ldquo;Radio&rdquo; tab mounted along the bottom navigation bar), works just as it has in Pandora and Spotify before it, using either pre-made genre stations or the &ldquo;Start Radio from this song&rdquo; feature to acutely customize your playlist</p>\n\n<p>.<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221398\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x680xFullSizeRender-20-602x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.QblW_n-S9H.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:680px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you watched Apple&rsquo;s Music keynote earlier this month, you&rsquo;ll know the company has also debuted one major addition that&rsquo;s exclusive to its service alone: real, live radio. Instead of simply selecting a series of songs to listen to, Beats 1 Radio will feature actual DJs, in-studio interviews, and all the bonuses you&rsquo;d expect from a full-fledged radio station in your car. Combine this with NPR and ESPN Radio, and Apple&rsquo;s already&nbsp;got themselves a nice head start into the live market over their competition.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (19)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221399\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x415xFullSizeRender-19.jpg.pagespeed.ic.Gwm7lAow95.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:415px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"imageedit_7_4394847884\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221437\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x294ximageedit_7_4394847884.jpg.pagespeed.ic.f_Hnbheh69.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:294px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Assorted Perks</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Aside from these choice picks&nbsp;though, most of what you&rsquo;ll find on Apple Music has already existed on Spotify for years now. Sections in Music like &ldquo;Staff Picks&rdquo; &ldquo;Mood Playlists&rdquo; &ldquo;Content Curators&rdquo; are all long-term staples of the Spotify brand, but Apple does the feature justice by making the music easy to sort through, and even easier to save to an outside playlist of your own design.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (28)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221413\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x673xFullSizeRender-28-608x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.xJjMvHwQWp.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:673px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For You&rdquo; is essentially a glorified &ldquo;Discover&rdquo; panel in&nbsp;Spotify, and both feature a rich set of suggested playlists that are generated based on the artists you&rsquo;ve liked or listened to previously. Here you can listen to all kinds of music that you might not ever find on your own, some put together by real humans at the Apple Music team, while the rest is procedurally calculated the more often you use the app.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (15)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221392\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x544xFullSizeRender-15.jpg.pagespeed.ic.sVJ8Eogl7e.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:544px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Subscription Pricing and Overall Value</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Apple knows they&rsquo;re late to the streaming game, and to make up for their lag in getting to the front of the pack, they&rsquo;re offering a free three&nbsp;month subscription to anyone who wants to sign up for the service.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (35)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221418\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/400x424xFullSizeRender-35.jpg.pagespeed.ic.2rCniCStua.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:424px; margin-left:-2px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Spotify has responded in kind however, by giving new users the opportunity to sign up for three months of its own premium service for just $0.99 cents. The move is an obvious jab at Apple&rsquo;s plan, but either way you still end up getting a huge discount if you plan to keep the account active over the next year.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"imageedit_10_8343228049\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-221438\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/650x288ximageedit_10_8343228049-650x288.jpg.pagespeed.ic.pJzxktTfLV.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:288px; margin-left:-2px; width:650px\" /></p>\n\n<p>As far as user coverage is concerned, Apple is the clear winner with 100+ countries signed up and counting. Not all songs will be available in all regions, but considering that Spotify has only crested at about half as many markets (58), you should be sure to check the company&rsquo;s websites and TOS to verify whether or not you&rsquo;ll have listening privileges before dropping any debit cards on a month of service.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"imageedit_13_4697776582\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221439\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x552ximageedit_13_4697776582-603x1024.gif.pagespeed.ic.w1FVjgyn25.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:552px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (39)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221414\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/325x540xFullSizeRender-391-616x1024.jpg.pagespeed.ic.gotTfcRT-q.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:540px; margin-left:-2px; width:325px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which; if at any time you decide you don&rsquo;t want to renew after your first three months are up, you can cancel your subscription by entering the Account tab (top right portrait). Select the &ldquo;Apple ID&rdquo; option, and in Account Settings you&rsquo;ll see the Manage option about three rows down.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"FullSizeRender (18)\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-221400\" src=\"http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/450x553xFullSizeRender-18.jpg.pagespeed.ic.rsVBPaaKdF.webp\" style=\"border:0px; height:553px; margin-left:-2px; width:450px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Flip the &ldquo;Automatic Renewal&rdquo; toggle from on to off, and your account won&rsquo;t be debited after the 90-day trial expires.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Apple Music may not be taking a revolutionary step in the world of online streaming services, but it still gives new subscribers&nbsp;enough fresh&nbsp;features and plentiful radio offerings to give the likes of Spotify and Tidal a run for their money.</p>\n\n<p>As with those services, for $9.99 you won&rsquo;t find a better deal to get all your favorite artists streamed straight to your phone from wherever you are in the world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/221356/what-is-apple-music-and-how-does-it-work/\">http://www.howtogeek.com/221356/what-is-apple-music-and-how-does-it-work/</a></p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-02 12:37:11',NULL,NULL,NULL),

I had a circle of friends who were similarly drawn to the exotica of pop culture (or, at least, what was considered pop culture at the time in northern Virginia)&mdash;Monty Python, post-punk music, comic books, slasher films, and videogames.

So we each built our own otakuesque thought-palace, which we crammed with facts and nonsense&mdash;only now, the thought-palace was nicely appointed, decorated neatly, the information laid out on deep mahogany shelves or framed in gilt. What once set us apart, we hoped, would become a lovable quirk.</p>\n\n<p>Our respective nerdery took on various forms: One friend was the first to get his hands on early bootlegs of Asian action flicks by Tsui Hark and John Woo, and he never looked back. Another started reading William Gibson and peppered his conversations with cryptic (and alluring) references to &ldquo;cyberspace.&rdquo; I was ground zero for the &ldquo;new wave&rdquo; of mainstream superhero comics&mdash;which meant being right there for Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Neil Gaiman.

Something about which, while we moved&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:exchange ssm 4i,exchange ssm 4r,georgia,serif\">with</span>the herd, we could share a wink and a nod with two or three other similarly connected herdlings.</p>\n\n<p>When our coworkers nodded along to Springsteen and Madonna songs at the local Bennigan&rsquo;s, my select friends and I would quietly trade out-of-context lines from&nbsp;<cite>Monty Python</cite>&nbsp;sketches&mdash;a thieves&rsquo; cant, a code language used for identification.

I wasn&rsquo;t seeing the hard line between &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; and &ldquo;normals&rdquo; anymore. It was the last year that a T-shirt or music preference or pastime (Dungeons &amp; Dragons had long since lost its dangerous, Satanic, suicide-inducing street cred) could set you apart from the surface dwellers. Pretty soon, being the only person who was into something didn&rsquo;t make you outcast; it made you ahead of the curve and someone people were quicker to befriend than shun.

Nevertheless, there are still details to be found amongst the tests, which require companies to disclose whether or not the radios inside these gadgets are safe for use around humans.

So instead of speculating about the shape of the device based on the size and position of a sticker, we get to speculate on the software of the device. Here, the GG1&#39;s documentation also gives us details: it&#39;s going to appear on a particularly Glass-like rectangular display and it&#39;s available on a submenu that requires users to &quot;scroll left and right&quot; &mdash; the scrolling directions used on the last version of Glass.</p>\n\n<p>Does all that add up to solid proof that the GG1 is the next version of Glass and that it will be coming out in 2015?

Beats 1 will play the same music, with the same DJ commentary and curation, at the same time for everyone worldwide.</span></h3>\n\n<p>Apple Music differs from rivals by having a live worldwide radio station, a platform for artists to interact with fans and the ability to control the experience with voice commands.</p>\n\n<p>The second is Connect. The section lets artists share lyrics, backstage photos, songs and videos directly with fans and get their feedback. Musicians and fans can interact -- listeners can comment and artists can respond, plus anything posted is shareable on Messages, Facebook, Twitter and email. Though other subscription services let artists use the platforms to reach fans, Connect is the most elaborate and dedicated platform so far.</p>\n\n<p>The last is Siri integration. It&#39;s more consumer-focused than Connect, which holds the most appeal for artists as a way to reach fans, and it&#39;s more engaging than Beats 1, which is designed to be something you can play and just lean back to hear for a while.</p>\n\n<p>Music voice commands aren&#39;t unique to Apple Music. Google Now, the voice recognition element to Google&#39;s&nbsp;Android&nbsp;mobile operating system, allows users to perform simple commands like playing the specific song or pausing a track, but won&#39;t respond to more conversational requests like &quot;play the song from the movie &#39;Boyhood.&#39;&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Amazon introduced its voice-activated, Internet-connected wireless speaker Echo last year, and it is shipping the device to consumers widely starting next month. It can play specific songs from the Prime Music service that is part of Amazon&#39;s $99-a-year membership program, and it will spin up stations you&#39;ve created on Pandora or iHeart Radio if you link an account.</p>\n\n<p>But Siri&#39;s range of commands appear to be more sophisticated. And Echo stays in your home, while Siri follows you on your smartphone. That&#39;s a key point since streaming music services routinely report that most of their listening is on mobile devices.</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-03 06:37:23',NULL,NULL,NULL),

It is supposedly based on a device that was originally announced at Mobile World Congress back in March, and back then the best image we had to go off of was a low-resolution snapshot of the device being held up on stage. Now, Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) has posted a high-resolution render of the device, codenamed Venice, to Twitter.',NULL,'<p>It reveals the aforementioned display, curved at the sides like the&nbsp;Samsung&nbsp;Galaxy S6 Edge. There&#39;s a speaker at the bottom, and if you look closely at the last photo you can see that the basic design mostly matches up. It looks as though BlackBerry has chosen to excise dedicated Send and End keys &mdash; presumably because the device is now going to run Android instead of BlackBerry 10. It also seem possible that there&#39;s still a keyboard scurried away underneath that screen. The one other notable thing about Blass&#39; image is that it has Google app icons strewn about &mdash; which should mean that it has full access to&nbsp;Google&#39;s&nbsp;suite of apps and services. Blass also claims that the&nbsp;Venice will be coming to AT&amp;T.</p>\n\n<p>Last month,&nbsp;Reuters originally reported&nbsp;that BlackBerry would make the switch to Android. If this render proves accurate (and Blass has a long history of posting accurate leaks), it might well be coming soon. It&#39;s been a very long time since there&#39;s been a decent Android device with a physical keyboard and an even longer time since there&#39;s been a vertical sliding phone with a physical keyboard.

It’s cube-shaped and measures less than 1.5 inches long on every side. It shoots 1440p video at 30 frames per second, 1080p up to 60 frames per second, and 720p up to 100 frames per second. It’s waterproof up to 10 meters so it doesn’t require a bulky housing, which made it the perfect camera to stick on the hand that I was using on top of my paddle. It got the shot.','0','<p>The Session is extremely simple to use: you start and stop it with just one press of a button. In fact, the Session only has two buttons. The main one is a red, circular button found on the top side of the camera. Tap it, and the Session turns on and starts recording. Tap it again to stop recording, and the Session turns off. YOU OPERATE THE SESSION WITH ONE BUTTON, AND IT HELPS SAVE BATTERY This helps with battery life &mdash; a problem GoPro has long battled with its cameras. The Session&rsquo;s internal battery should last between one to two hours running consistently, but turning it on and off each time stretches the battery life much further. When I started the hour-and-a-half rafting trip, the Session had two-thirds of its battery life remaining, and by the end, it had outlasted a fully charged Hero 4 Black and Hero+ LCD. A 3-second press-and-hold on the main button will trigger a time-lapse photo mode. If you want to shoot single or burst photos, however, you have to change to these modes in the GoPro app. The only other button on the Session is for turning the camera&rsquo;s Wi-Fi on and off.</p>\n\n<div class=\"m-feature__body\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;\">\n<div class=\"m-photo-essay\" id=\"gallery8663426\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; clear: both;\">\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<p>In fact, to change any settings on the Session, you have to use GoPro&rsquo;s app or the included Wi-Fi remote. That&rsquo;s probably for the best, considering there are only two buttons and just one tiny screen on the camera. But GoPro has improved the ease of its on-camera menu system over the years, so if you&rsquo;ve gotten used to changing your settings on the fly, it could take some time to acclimate to the Session.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzMRr5eTtho\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of the Session&rsquo;s small size is how much harder it is to notice, no matter where you mount it. GoPro has also slimmed down its cameras over the years &mdash; the Hero 4 Black and Silver, in particular, are very light and small &mdash; but when you snap them into a housing and mount them to a helmet or to your wrist, you definitely still feel them when you&rsquo;re moving around.</p>\n\n<p>THE HERO 4 SESSION IS WATERPROOF OUT OF THE BOX</p>\n\n<p>The Session, on the other hand, is waterproof out of the box. It does use a small skeleton case (much like the&nbsp;frame mount&nbsp;the company sells for its bigger Hero cameras, but cubed) in order to attach it to the various mounts. I mounted it to my hand during our rafting trip and could barely feel it as we sped down the river. A bigger Hero 4 stuck inside a waterproof housing would have been much more cumbersome.</p>\n\n<p>Ditching the need for a housing also solves another long-standing problem with GoPro&#39;s cameras: the audio. The Session has two microphones &mdash; one on the front, and one on the back &mdash; and it dynamically switches between them to reduces wind noise. They never get muffled, and they&#39;re built to drain liquid fast, so the audio even sounds good when the camera comes out from underwater.</p>\n\n<p>As small as it looks on its own, when you place a Session next to a naked Hero 4 Black or Silver, they don&rsquo;t look that much different. Put them in their various mounts and cases, though, and you can&rsquo;t help but notice how much space the Session saves you.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\n	<li><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazy-loaded vox-lazy-load\" src=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TyN7o130L9ypmITADe__C0fhIk=/1020x0/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3847354/gopro-hero-4-session-03055.0.png\" style=\"border:0px;

The developers put each smartwatch to the same test, swimming four full lengths of the London Aquatic Centre&#39;s 50 meter pool. The test proved successful, with the Apple Watch mirroring the Pebble&#39;s results of a four lap, 200 meter swim. Apple&#39;s smartwatch even continued to measure heart rate successfully, raising from an initial 88bpm to 138bpm immediately after the test finished.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(4, 20, 39)\">The only downside for the app is that the Apple Watch experiences a tiny bit of lag when waking it up to check out lap times, the developers explaining that only when the screen is awake can the app run through the data samples collected from the swim and take a few seconds to parse through the information and display it on screen. Elsewhere, the swimming data isn&#39;t locked into the app, all of the workout and heart rate information getting delivered to HealthKit like any other workout and adding to a user&#39;s daily exercise and move goals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<div id=\"video-wrapper\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; zoom: 1; width: 560px; max-width: 100%;\">\n<div id=\"video-container\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 25px 0px 315px; box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; zoom: 1; position: relative; height: 0px; overflow: hidden; text-align: center;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1j2ZgcdkAvA?rel=0\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 560px; height: 340px;\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\n</div>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(4, 20, 39)\">Of course, even though the app works, the developers are still referring to it as an &quot;interesting technology demo,&quot; seeing that App Store Guidelines will immediately shut it down for encouraging users to use the Watch &quot;in a way that may cause damage to the device.&quot; In the end, the app&#39;s creators just hope that Apple hears the calls for a fully-waterproof smartwatch and includes such features in the device&#39;s next generation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>We really hope that Apple see the demand for an official, fully waterproofed Apple Watch. Once that is available, we&rsquo;ll be able to ship a fully featured swimming app. In the mean time, it would be great to see swimming become a first class citizen in the Apple Health and Activities apps.

I could draw, I had studied design. So Steve would describe it to me, I&#39;d draw it out.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Jobs-dictated concept for the Mac Phone saw a desktop phone equipped with a screen running the Mac OS of the day, allowing 1980s businessmen to multitask in a way that was currently unheard of.

This past Friday, it appears, Instagram has started addressing that very issue, as photos sent to the popular image sharing app are now being stored in a higher 1080 x 1080 size.','0','<p>The higher-resolution pictures are not yet being displayed as such by Instagram, which maintains its smaller default for now. But a quick check of the source code on Instagram&#39;s web view reveals that new photos uploaded to it are being saved in 1080px resolution, likely in preparation to making a full and public switch to the greater size in the coming days or weeks. We have reached out to Instagram to find out more. The company&#39;s last comments on the matter indicated that it neither uploads nor stores images at any greater resolution that its standard 640 x 640, so this is clearly a new development.</p>\n\n<p>NOT YET OFFICIAL, BUT VERY DEFINITELY REAL: 1080 X 1080 INSTAGRAMS</p>\n\n<p><em>Verge</em>&nbsp;reader Alejandro de la Torre was among the first to spot the larger Instagrams, stumbling upon the bigger preview when he received a link&nbsp;via<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5445864/telegram-messenger-hottest-app-in-the-world\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(250, 75, 42); text-decoration: none; background: transparent;\"> </a>Telegram. It&#39;s important to note that these aren&#39;t merely 640px images stretched out to fill the larger size; we are looking at legitimate 1080px photos, with a quality reasonably close to the original. It&#39;s too soon to say whether Instagram&#39;s persistent issue of over-compressing images coming from its Android app has been addressed, but both Android and iOS uploads are being stored in the higher res now. Check out a few of our latest posts on Instagram below, accompanied by their larger, more beautiful versions.</p>\n\n<p>To uncover your own 1080px photos, use a desktop browser like Chrome or Firefox to open up an Instagram photo page&#39;s source HTML code, then search for &quot;.jpg&quot; within it.

Apple Music runs at a slightly lower 256kbps, but it uses a better encoding scheme, AAC, than Spotify&#39;s MP3 and Ogg Vorbis.</p>\n\n<p>But what does this all actually mean in the real world? We wanted to find out, so we put a bunch of Vox Media staff in front of the camera for a blind test between Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music.</p>\n\n<p>The methodology was straightforward: subjects listened to the same segment of the same song back-to-back on all three services set to their maximum streaming bitrates. We used Sony&#39;s MDR-7506 headphones &mdash; selected for their popularity, neutral sound, and non-outrageous price tag &mdash; paired to an iPhone 6 Plus. Subjects judged a total of three songs covering a spectrum of genres and audio characteristics: Kendrick Lamar&#39;s &quot;Complexion (A Zulu Love),&quot; St. Vincent&#39;s &quot;Digital Witness,&quot; and Aaron Copland&#39;s &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; off the&nbsp;<em>Copland Conducts Copland</em>&nbsp;compilation. After listening to each song, we asked them to just say whatever was on their mind &mdash; if one service sounded notably better, notably worse, or if all three were about the same.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>THE RESULTS WERE VERY, VERY SURPRISING TO ME</strong></p>\n\n<p>The results were very, very surprising to me. It was generally random across the board, though Spotify fared slightly worse than Apple Music and Tidal overall. In roughly 29 percent of the tests, subjects couldn&#39;t tell any notable difference at all. Tidal &mdash; which wants you to pay more for lossless quality &mdash; most definitely didn&#39;t take the crown, and in several cases, subjects actually identified it as the worst-sounding of the three.</p>\n\n<p>What are the takeaways? Having been a longtime Tidal subscriber and run blind tests on my laptop between Tidal and Spotify in the past, it seems possible that the difference in quality is particularly irrelevant when you&#39;re using your phone &mdash; maybe it&#39;s one thing to use better components, headphones, and speakers, but a phone&#39;s hardware creates a baseline that renders Tidal&#39;s advantage totally useless. (That&#39;s good news if you mostly listen to streaming music on your phone, since Tidal&#39;s lossless service is $10 more per month.)</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, remember that St. Vincent likes crunchy horns.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n\n<p>http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/7/8872115/apple-music-tidal-spotify-audio-quality-test</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-07 06:37:20',NULL,NULL,NULL),

This finding highlights the fine line between &ldquo;adware,&rdquo; which isn&rsquo;t traditionally prevented by antivirus products, and malware, with its ability to cause harm.</p>\n\n<p>Samples of Gunpoder have been uploaded to VirusTotal since November 2014, with all antivirus engines reporting either &ldquo;benign&rdquo; or &ldquo;adware&rdquo; verdicts, meaning legacy controls would not prevent installation of this malware. While researching the sample, we observed that while it contained many characteristics of adware, and indeed embeds a popular adware library within it, a number of overtly malicious activities were also discovered, which we believe characterizes this family as being malware, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Collecting sensitive information from users</li>\n	<li>Propagating itself via SMS message</li>\n	<li>Potentially pushing fraudulent advertisements</li>\n	<li>Ability to execute additional payloads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Gunpoder targets Android users in at least 13 different countries, including Iraq, Thailand, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Russia, France, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Italy, the United States, and Spain. One interesting observation from the reverse engineering of Gunpoder is that this new Android family only propagates among users outside of China.</p>\n\n<p>Unit 42 investigated Gunpoder using the Palo Alto Networks&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paloaltonetworks.com/autofocus\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(112, 144, 27); background-repeat: no-repeat;\" target=\"_blank\">AutoFocus</a>&nbsp;service, and released protections for users of WildFire, Threat Prevention and Mobile Security Manager for all currently known Gunpoder variants. Thanks to Palo Alto Networks unique prevention capabilities across the attack lifecycle, future members of the Gunpoder malware family could also potentially be blocked.</p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3>Evading Detection</h3>\n\n<p>By examining the reverse-engineered samples, we found the malware author applied several unique techniques to evade antivirus detection:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Gunpoder samples include aggressive advertisement libraries, such as Airpush, within the samples. Those ad libraries are easily detected and may also include aggressive behaviors. The malware samples successfully use these advertisement libraries to hide malicious behaviors from detection by antivirus engines. While antivirus engines may flag Gunpoder as being adware, by not flagging it as being overtly malicious, most engines will not prevent Gunpoder from executing. Figure 1 shows the VirusTotal scan results on one sample.</li>\n	<li>Users who have executed Gunpoder are shown a notification that includes the Airpush library. We believe the notification was intentionally added in order to use the Airpush library as a scapegoat.</li>\n	<li>Gunpoder samples embed malicious code within popular Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator games, which are based on an open source game framework (http://sourceforge.net/p/nesoid/code/ci/master/tree/). Palo Alto Networks has witnessed a trend of malware authors re-packaging open source Android applications with malicious code. Gonpoder makes use of this technique, which makes it difficult to distinguish malicious code when performing static analysis.</li>\n	<li>Gunpoder targets users not residing in China. Samples observed support online payments, including PayPal, Skrill, Xsolla and CYPay.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gunpoder-1.png\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(112, 144, 27); background-repeat: no-repeat;\"><img alt=\"gunpoder 1\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-9608\" src=\"http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gunpoder-1-500x528.png\" style=\"background-repeat:no-repeat; border:0px; display:block; height:528px; margin:0px; outline:0px; padding:0px; width:500px\" /></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>\n\n<p>http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/new-android-malware-family-evades-antivirus-detection-by-using-popular-ad-libraries/</p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-08 06:37:29',NULL,NULL,NULL),

On average, messaging apps are used an average of almost nine times a day, compared with 1.9 for all apps, according to the Flurry mobile-analytics unit of Yahoo Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Inside Facebook, Deutsche Bank estimates that users tap its WhatsApp and Messenger texting apps 25 to 30 times a day, compared with 15 for the main Facebook feed. Analysts expect WhatsApp to reach a billion users by early next year, seven years after it began&mdash;two years faster than Facebook itself hit that mark.</p>\n\n<p>Students of communication say the growth of messaging apps is natural, because one-to-one chats more closely mirror how people interact every day. Users aren&rsquo;t abandoning Facebook, but its purpose has changed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;WhatsApp is filling a more primary need than social media&rdquo; sites like Facebook and Twitter, said&nbsp;Scott Campbell,&nbsp;professor of mobile communications at the University of Michigan. &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s something kind of evolutionary about it, something kind of clannish.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Facebook itself has embraced the trend. Beyond acquiring WhatsApp for $22 billion in 2014, it also developed and promoted Messenger, which now boasts more than 700 million users.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We believe that messaging, it&rsquo;s one of the few things that people actually do more than social networking,&rdquo; Facebook founder and Chief Executive&nbsp;<a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/Z/Mark-Zuckerberg/408\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>&nbsp;said during a public question-and-answer session last year.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the shift poses risks for Facebook, which makes money by inserting advertising in users&rsquo; &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; of posts by their friends. Many messaging apps don&rsquo;t show messages in a similar stream, making it more challenging to display ads.</p>\n\n<p>Some Asian messaging services generate revenue in other ways. Roughly 550 million people in China turn to&nbsp;<a class=\"company-name\" href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/TCEHY\" style=\"margin: 0px 4px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">WeChat</a>&nbsp;each month to keep tabs on friends, play mobile games and watch NBA games, with parent&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/TCEHY\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">Tencent Holdings</a>&nbsp;Ltd.&nbsp;getting a cut when users make purchases of real or virtual goods. It also places ads in its &ldquo;Moments&rdquo; feed, which is similar to Facebook&rsquo;s news feed.</p>\n\n<p>Line, which is popular in Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, makes money through in-app purchases and by selling packs of online stickers for about $1.99 apiece to its 205 million monthly active users.</p>\n\n<p>So far, such initiatives don&rsquo;t generate anywhere near as much revenue as Facebook ads. Line, WeChat and Korea&rsquo;s KakaoTalk collect $1.50 to $3 a year per monthly active user, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst&nbsp;Mark Mahaney.&nbsp;That is less than one-third of Facebook&rsquo;s $9.45 in revenue per monthly user in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook hinted at future plans in March when it opened Messenger to outside developers who made photo and video apps for the messaging platform. It also added a feature to allow users to track orders from online retailers Zulily Inc. and Everlane. For now, none of those features generate revenue.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/M/David-Marcus/6930\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px;\">David Marcus</a>,&nbsp;head of Messenger, says Facebook understands the challenge and must &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; the Asian messaging apps.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Right now, we make no money on Messenger,&rdquo; Mr. Marcus said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re hopeful that over time we&rsquo;ll find out a really good business model for Messenger and one that&rsquo;s very sustainable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, Facebook isn&#39;t going away. Some 1.44 billion people visit Facebook at least once a month. The social network is adding tens of millions of users each month, many in developing countries who see Facebook as &ldquo;the Internet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>On average, though, Facebook users are sharing less. Roughly 42% of Facebook users said they posted a status update or commented on the social network in the first quarter&mdash;down from 69% in the first quarter of 2013, according to surveys by market researcher GlobalWebIndex.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The rise of Messenger, WhatsApp and others is causing behaviors on &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; networks to become much more passive,&rdquo; said Jason Mander, head of trends for GlobalWebIndex. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not leaving sites like Facebook per se, but we are using them for fewer things.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Christie Silver, a 39-year-old freelance writer in Red Bank, N.J., used to discuss her political beliefs on Facebook. These days, she shares only news stories and pictures of her children. Ms. Silver says she stopped posting about her beliefs after one too many judgmental comments from Facebook friends. She now stays in touch with her husband and friend through texts on Google Hangouts.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use Facebook the way I used to,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When I look at the status updates that I put up six years ago, it was more about my state of mind.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Facebook&rsquo;s Mr. Marcus says social-media use is changing, but the number of users on Facebook, and the time they spend on the network are both increasing. &ldquo;So I think that&rsquo;s not a problem,&rdquo; he adds.</p>\n\n<p>Some users are experimenting with messaging apps in ways that bend the one-to-one model, creating a hybrid form of communication.</p>\n\n<p>At Luther Burbank High School in Sacramento, Calif., teachers use WhatsApp to help non-English-speaking students learn the language. Most students already had the app, so teachers created a group chat for the class. Teachers pose a daily question in English by text and audio message to the group, giving students until the morning to respond.</p>\n\n<p>Larry Ferlazzo, who has taught English for nonnative speakers for 11 years at the inner-city school, says WhatsApp lets students speak and write their answers. &ldquo;Both features are important for learners of a second language,&rdquo; he says.Mr. Ferlazzo says it would be challenging to use Facebook in a similar way. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to all &lsquo;friend&rsquo; everybody else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That might put unnecessary pressure on students to friend their teachers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Write to&nbsp;Deepa Seetharaman at&nbsp;<a class=\"icon \" href=\"mailto:Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 128, 195); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; background: 0px 0px / 30px 30px no-repeat;\" target=\"_blank\">Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com</a></p>\n','g-ocanto','0','2015-07-09 05:37:44',NULL,NULL,NULL),
